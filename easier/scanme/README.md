# Scan Me
## Misc

My friend gave me this file and said to scan it, but I donâ€™t see anything!


- In VSCode, and other text editors, if you highlight something it will highlight all other instances of that text. Through trial and error highlighting, you will reveal a qr code
- You may not be able to scan it directly, so screenshot it and upload it to some online QR code reader


CTF{like_magic!}
