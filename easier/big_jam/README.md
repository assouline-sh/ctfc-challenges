# Big Jam
## OSINT

My neighbors are having a party and the music is too loud! I want to jam their router (FCC ID: Q87-WRT54GV81) and it would be nice to know the frequency (in MHz) for its channel 6.
Wrap that value in CTF{}. No need to include units.


- Look up FCC ID, with a website like https://fccid.io/
- Scroll down, click on RF Exposure Info, scroll to page 4
- The answer is in the table


CTF{2437}
