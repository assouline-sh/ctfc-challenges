# Totally Lucky
## OSINT

 I was so lucky my antivirus detected a malicious file on my laptop with the hash: a259082f33573151375ea00df28468fd
    
I want to know more about it, though. This file makes a shell command
with a URL inside of it. What is the full URL contained?
Format the flag as: CTF{http://domain.tld/file.extension}

- Lookup hash on virus total, go to behavior tab, scroll down to shell commands
