Paws posted this picture, but I can't seem to open it. It's very hexing- i mean vexing...

- `hexedit ctf` and scroll to the bottom to see the flag.
- You also can't open the image because the header is changed to "HEHE". Change to PNG headers to open the file, but this is not necessary to solve the challenge. Serves as a red herring
