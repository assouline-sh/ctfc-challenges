# Where’s the fight?
## Misc

Puckman sent me this photo of where our next fight is gonna be. What is the name of the location in the photo?
Note: Wrap location in CTF{}

- Run frcrackzip with rockyou.txt to unzip the password protected zip. Password is ‘fightclub’
- File is .mov but is actually a .jpg, so rename extension to open the file
- Run ‘exiftool’ to get GPS coordinates and look it up on google
