- You could brute force the buttons, or inspect the source code and see it calls a script main.js. Look at this code, see that it creates the flag boxes and has a variable that stores the encrypted flag
- You can add either console.log(flagbox) under line 13 or console.log(x) under line 28 to determine which box has the flag or the decryption of the flag, respectively. With this added line, execute main.js in the console to get the flag.
