# Inspect(rogram)
## Forensic

I also found this new song in my music library that wasnâ€™t there before. What song even is this?

- Title hints to spectrogram, which is how the audio looks visually. You can upload the file to an online spectrum analyzer like https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/
- The audio visually says to check the metadata. Run exiftool on the wav and the artist is the flag
