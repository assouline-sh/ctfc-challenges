# Lunar Light
## Forensic

Sometimes you need more than just moonlight to really see an image!

- `file lunar` to see it is a png, change extension to .png
- exiftool on the image and see comment saying they love editing photos with high contrast
- upload image to some online tool to change image contrast (reduce contrast as much as possible) and flag is legible if you really zoom in and look
