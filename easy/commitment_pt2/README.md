# Commitment Pt2
## Misc

Okay I think I learned from the first time how to commit…. But I accidentally committed some important info. Don’t worry though- I deleted it! 


- Another git repo. `Git log` this time won’t work, need to do ‘git reflog’ to see a record of ALL commits. 
- See that there seems to be a deleted branch called my-branch, and one of the commits says “important info”. 
- Git checkout that commit id `git checkout 20497e3`, then `ls` and see flag.txt with the flag
